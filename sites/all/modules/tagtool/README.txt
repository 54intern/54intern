Summary
-------
This module is an enhance for free-tagging taxonomy field.

Tag is free, but one major problem of autocomplete input style 
is that we don't have enough guide for customer. Sometimes we 
need to let user "choose" exists tag by simple click, and of 
course they still can add their own defined tag in textfield.
